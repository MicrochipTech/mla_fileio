  Side Effects:
    None.
  Description:
    FILEIO_SD_SendCmd prepares a command packet and sends it out over the SPI interface.
    Response data of type 'R1' (as indicated by the SD/MMC product manual is returned.
    This function is intended to be used when the clock speed of a PIC18 device is
    so high that the maximum SPI divider can't reduce the clock below the maximum
    SD card initialization sequence speed.
  Remarks:
    None.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    uint8_t FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks(FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO* info)
  Summary:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based read function that reads 
    data packets from the media, and copies them to a user specified RAM buffer.
  Pre-Conditions:
    The FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure must be initialized correctly, prior to calling
    this function for the first time.  Certain parameters, such as the user
    data buffer pointer (pBuffer) in the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO struct are allowed to be changed
    by the application firmware, in between each call to FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks().
    Additionally, the media and microcontroller SPI module should have already 
    been initialized before using this function.  This function is mutually
    exclusive with the FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks() function.  Only one operation
    (either one read or one write) is allowed to be in progress at a time, as
    both functions share statically allocated resources and monopolize the SPI bus.
  Input:
    FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO* info -        A pointer to a FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure.  The 
                            structure contains information about how to complete
                            the read operation (ex: number of total bytes to read,
                            where to copy them once read, maximum number of bytes
                            to return for each call to FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks(), etc.).
  Return Values:
    uint8_t - Returns a status uint8_t indicating the current state of the read 
            operation. The possible return values are:
            
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_BUSY - Returned when the state machine is busy waiting for
                             a data start token from the media.  The media has a
                             random access time, which can often be quite long
                             (<= ~3ms typ, with maximum of 100ms).  No data
                             has been copied yet in this case, and the application
                             should keep calling FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() until either
                             an error/timeout occurs, or FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY
                             is returned.
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY -   Returned after a single packet, of
                                            the specified size (in info->numuint8_ts),
                                            is ready to be read from the 
                                            media and copied to the user 
                                            specified data buffer.  Often, after
                                            receiving this return value, the 
                                            application firmware would want to
                                            update the info->pReceiveBuffer pointer
                                            before calling FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks()
                                            again.  This way, the application can
                                            begin fetching the next packet worth
                                            of data, while still using/consuming
                                            the previous packet of data.
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_COMPLETE - Returned when all data bytes in the read
                                 operation have been read and returned successfully,
                                 and the media is now ready for the next operation.
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_ERROR - Returned when some failure occurs.  This could be
                               either due to a media timeout, or due to some other
                               unknown type of error.  In this case, the 
                               FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() handler will terminate
                               the read attempt and will try to put the media 
                               back in a default state, ready for a new command.  
                               The application firmware may then retry the read
                               attempt (if desired) by re-initializing the 
                               FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure and setting the 
                               bStateVariable = FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_QUEUED.

            
  Side Effects:
    Uses the SPI bus and the media.  The media and SPI bus should not be
    used by any other function until the read operation has either completed
    successfully, or returned with the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_ERROR condition.
  Description:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based read function that reads 
    data packets from the media, and copies them to a user specified RAM buffer.
    This function uses the multi-block read command (and stop transmission command) 
    to perform fast reads of data.  The total amount of data that will be returned 
    on any given call to FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() will be the info->numuint8_ts parameter.
    However, if the function is called repeatedly, with info->uint8_tsRemaining set
    to a large number, this function can successfully fetch data sizes >> than
    the block size (theoretically anything up to ~4GB, since bytesRemaining is
    a 32-bit uint32_t).  The application firmware should continue calling 
    FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks(), until the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_COMPLETE value is returned 
    (or FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_ERROR), even if it has already received all of the data expected.
    This is necessary, so the state machine can issue the CMD12 (STOP_TRANMISSION) 
    to terminate the multi-block read operation, once the total expected number 
    of bytes have been read.  This puts the media back into the default state
    ready for a new command.
    
    During normal/successful operations, calls to FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() 
    would typically return:
    1. FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_BUSY - repeatedly up to several milliseconds, then 
    2. FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY - repeatedly, until 512 bytes [media read
        block size] is received, then 
    3. Back to FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_BUSY (for awhile, may be short), then
    4. Back to FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_NEW_PACKET_READY (repeatedly, until the next 512 byte
       boundary, then back to #3, etc.
    5. After all data is received successfully, then the function will return 
       FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_COMPLETE, for all subsequent calls (until a new read operation
       is started, by re-initializing the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure, and re-calling
       the function).
    
  Remarks:
    This function will monopolize the SPI module during the operation.  Do not
    use the SPI module for any other purpose, while a fetch operation is in
    progress.  Additionally, the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure must not be modified
    in a different context, while the FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() function is executing.
    In between calls to FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks(), certain parameters, namely the
    info->numbytes and info->pReceiveBuffer are allowed to change however.
    
    The bytesRemaining value must always be an exact integer multiple of numuint8_ts
    for the function to operate correctly.  Additionally, it is recommended, although
    not essential, for the bytesRemaining to be an integer multiple of the media
    read block size.
    
    When starting a read operation, the info->stateVariable must be initialized to
    FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_READ_QUEUED.  All other fields in the info structure should also be
    initialized correctly.
    
    The info->wNumBytes must always be less than or equal to the media block size,
    (which is 512 bytes).  Additionally, info->wNumBytes must always be an exact
    integer factor of the media block size (unless info->dwBytesRemaining is less
    than the media block size).  Example values that are allowed for info->wNumBytes
    are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512.

  Function:
    uint8_t FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks(FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO* info)
  Summary:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based write function that writes
    data from the user specified buffer, onto the media, at the specified 
    media block address.
  Pre-Conditions:
    The FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure must be initialized correctly, prior to calling
    this function for the first time.  Certain parameters, such as the user
    data buffer pointer (pBuffer) in the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO struct are allowed to be changed
    by the application firmware, in between each call to FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks().
    Additionally, the media and microcontroller SPI module should have already 
    been initialized before using this function.  This function is mutually
    exclusive with the FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() function.  Only one operation
    (either one read or one write) is allowed to be in progress at a time, as
    both functions share statically allocated resources and monopolize the SPI bus.
  Input:
    FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO* info -        A pointer to a FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure.  The 
                            structure contains information about how to complete
                            the write operation (ex: number of total uint8_ts to write,
                            where to obtain the uint8_ts from, number of uint8_ts
                            to write for each call to FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks(), etc.).
  Return Values:
    uint8_t - Returns a status uint8_t indicating the current state of the write 
            operation. The possible return values are:
            
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_BUSY - Returned when the state machine is busy waiting for
                             the media to become ready to accept new data.  The 
                             media has write time, which can often be quite long
                             (a few ms typ, with maximum of 250ms).  The application
                             should keep calling FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks() until either
                             an error/timeout occurs, FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET
                             is returned, or FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE is returned.
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET -   Returned when the FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks()
                                        handler is ready to consume data and send
                                        it to the media.  After FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET
                                        is returned, the application should make certain
                                        that the info->wNumuint8_ts and pBuffer parameters
                                        are correct, prior to calling 
                                        FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks() again.  After
                                        the function returns, the application is
                                        then free to write new data into the pBuffer
                                        RAM location. 
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE - Returned when all data uint8_ts in the write
                                 operation have been written to the media successfully,
                                 and the media is now ready for the next operation.
            FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_ERROR - Returned when some failure occurs.  This could be
                               either due to a media timeout, or due to some other
                               unknown type of error.  In this case, the 
                               FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks() handler will terminate
                               the write attempt and will try to put the media 
                               back in a default state, ready for a new command.  
                               The application firmware may then retry the write
                               attempt (if desired) by re-initializing the 
                               FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure and setting the 
                               bStateVariable = FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_QUEUED.

            
  Side Effects:
    Uses the SPI bus and the media.  The media and SPI bus should not be
    used by any other function until the read operation has either completed
    successfully, or returned with the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_ERROR condition.
  Description:
    Speed optimized, non-blocking, state machine based write function that writes 
    data packets to the media, from a user specified RAM buffer.
    This function uses either the single block or multi-block write command 
    to perform fast writes of the data.  The total amount of data that will be 
    written on any given call to FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks() will be the 
    info->numuint8_ts parameter.
    However, if the function is called repeatedly, with info->dwuint8_tsRemaining
    set to a large number, this function can successfully write data sizes >> than
    the block size (theoretically anything up to ~4GB, since dwuint8_tsRemaining is 
    a 32-bit uint32_t).  The application firmware should continue calling 
    FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks(), until the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE value is returned 
    (or FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_ERROR), even if it has already sent all of the data expected.
    This is necessary, so the state machine can finish the write process and 
    terminate the multi-block write operation, once the total expected number 
    of uint8_ts have been written.  This puts the media back into the default state 
    ready for a new command.
    
    During normal/successful operations, calls to FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks() 
    would typically return:
    1. FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET - repeatedly, until 512 uint8_ts [media read 
        block size] is received, then 
    2. FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_BUSY (for awhile, could be a long time, many milliseconds), then
    3. Back to FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_SEND_PACKET (repeatedly, until the next 512 uint8_t
       boundary, then back to #2, etc.
    4. After all data is copied successfully, then the function will return 
       FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_COMPLETE, for all subsequent calls (until a new write operation
       is started, by re-initializing the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure, and re-calling
       the function).
    
  Remarks:
    When starting a read operation, the info->stateVariable must be initialized to
    FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_WRITE_QUEUED.  All other fields in the info structure should also be
    initialized correctly.

    This function will monopolize the SPI module during the operation.  Do not
    use the SPI module for any other purpose, while a write operation is in
    progress.  Additionally, the FILEIO_SD_ASYNC_IO structure must not be modified
    in a different context, while the FILEIO_SD_AsyncReadTasks() function is 
    actively executing.
    In between calls to FILEIO_SD_AsyncWriteTasks(), certain parameters, namely the
    info->wNumuint8_ts and info->pBuffer are allowed to change however.
    
    The dwuint8_tsRemaining value must always be an exact integer multiple of wNumuint8_ts 
    for the function to operate correctly.  Additionally, it is required that
    the wNumuint8_ts parameter, must always be less than or equal to the media block size,
    (which is 512 uint8_ts).  Additionally, info->wNumuint8_ts must always be an exact 
    integer factor of the media block size.  Example values that are allowed for
    info->wNumuint8_ts are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512.
