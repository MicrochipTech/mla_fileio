The above test project(s) are created with NetBeans using the GCC compiler.

The tests run on an emulated drive with data captured from a real drive.

These drives are drives that were purchased for testing purposes and returns from customers that had a problem working with the file system.

Some of these drives do not work on Windows machines either.  Those drives have been removed from the test pool.  Only drives that operate properly on Windows are included in this test configuration.
